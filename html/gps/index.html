     <h2>Lorem</h2>
     <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

     <p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

 <h3> Reflection <h3>
 <p>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
 Specifies certain sections for each portion of a given html document. The footer and header tags give the page structure that makes the code more readable for another user and the browser as well. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The order goes from top to bottom. Thus if a given tag is before another it will be displayed before the aformentioned tag. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? Sublime has useful tools that are known as snippets that reduce the the time to create the formatting for documents that require it. I hope  to use better shortcuts so I can better focus on the content that goes into those documents. 


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

I had a difficult time understanding the differnce between the semantic tags. But each time we practiced throughout this excercise and I read the related articles it became clear what they were used for. I think that practice truly does make perfect in any skill, as cliche as that sounds.
