Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help?

 How often should you stop and test what you just learned?

Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why:

When learning a new topic, language, framework or technology I often use videos. I consider myself to be a highly visual learner and thus benefit from watching videos concurrently with practicing use. I find it useful to pause the video anytime I have a question and find out the answer using research. I find that this helps me learn significantly as it is something I would not have thought to do otherwise. Breaks are certainly important, it is important to stop and reflect on what you have done and let the information "soak" in. 

I found that asking my peers will be the best solution should I run  into problems. I have not been able to find the best practices to figure out this release but I will continue to refactor until I do so.
