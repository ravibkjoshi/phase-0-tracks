# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is the process in whch you can make changes to documents that allows one to test changes that do not affect the "master copy". Similar to creating a copy of a file in Google drive, you can make personal changes in a seperate file so it does not change in the original until you decide. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is the area that is a copy of the master that allows you to make changes without affecting the master until you commit.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the act of saving a change made to file. A commit message allows other users and often yourself to see the context of what was changed since the last commit. A good commit message is clear and concise in explaining the changes made in the aformentioned commit. It does not have to be verbose but it should not leave another user guessing where and what changes took place. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is a problem that occurs when the branch you are currently working in and the branch you wish to push to do not share the same commits that they are supposed to.
